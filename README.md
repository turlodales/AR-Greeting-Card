# AR Greeting Card
##Overview:
This is a novel app for iOS users with the augmented reality(AR) technology. In general, it is an mobile app which can help us customize our own electronic greeting cards for those special days, like birthday, valentine’s day or even wedding ceremony. Different from those normal e-card apps with just pictures and words, using AR E-card, we can easily make our greeting cards not only unique but also vividly. The design of our application now would support two kinds of E-card for users. The operations of both would be really simple and easy handled. The idea of first kind drives from normal greeting card in the real world. Our application would provide multiple styles of greeting card like Fig.1 with or without animations. After choosing one of the card, user can edit the content of it.  When use done with the editing and send it out. Their friend who receive it only need to find a flat surface, tap it on and watch that amazing card with touching words slowly open itself for them. The second mode provided for user deriving from a new feature of iOS 11.0 called Animoji. User just need to record a video, and then add some special effects like selecting a virtual background or change our face into a cute emoji, which is just for fun (Effect may like Fig.2). After those editing, with one simple click, we can send it to our friends via snapchat or WeChat. And what our friends would receive is the most ‘killing’ part of this app. Those who receive and open an AR E-card would see an customized emoji vividly projecting in their reality scene, just imagining in the Pokemon Go and Pikachu is replaced by your customized greetings.(Effect may like Fig.3) That is really amazing!

##Cool Point:
With the power of the trending AR technology and the growing number of astonishingly beautiful virtual design. This application can eventually provide more kinds of greeting than the famous greeting card company Hallmark. 
Apart from that, we think such a reality greeting with AR effect would deﬁnitely attract lots of people. Just a simple and real example, nowadays, there are so many young people like us, studying abroad, working far away from hometown, and when it comes to holidays especially Spring Festival, we can not go home and gather with family. That is really sad. At that moment, sending a normal greeting card is good but not good enough. Now with AR E-card app, our family can easily see our reality greeting video! What a harmony family union scene! Also a reality wedding invitation video, we think it is much more interesting and formal than just a e-invitation letter. we really believe it would attract a lot of users and become a killer app.
